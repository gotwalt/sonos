# Sonos

Control Sonos speakers with Ruby.

Huge thanks to [Rahim Sonawalla](https://github.com/rahims) for making [SoCo](https://github.com/rahims/SoCo). This gem would not be possible without his work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'sonos'
```

And then execute:

``` shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

``` shell
$ gem install sonos
```

## Usage

I'm working on a CLI client. For now, we'll use IRB.

``` shell
$ gem install sonos
$ irb
```

``` ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'sonos'
speakers = Sonos.discover.topology.map(&:speaker)
speakers = speaker.first
```

Now that we have a reference to the speaker, we can do all kinds of stuff.

``` ruby
speaker.pause # Pause whatever is playing
speaker.play  # Resumes the playlist
speaker.play 'http://assets.samsoff.es/music/Airports.mp3' # Stream!
speaker.now_playing
speaker.volume
speaker.volume = 70
speaker.volume -= 10
```


## To Do

* List other speakers
* Loudness
* Alarm clock
* Group management
    * Party Mode
    * Join
* Learn what all of the endpoints in `speaker.device_description_url` do
* Line-in (I don't have a PLAY:5, so I'll need help testing this one)
* Handle errors better
* Fix album art in `now_playing`
* Handle line-in in `now_playing`
* Better support for stero pairs
* CLI client
