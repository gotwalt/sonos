# Sonos

Control Sonos speakers with Ruby.

Huge thanks to [Rahim Sonawalla](https://github.com/rahims) for making [SoCo](https://github.com/rahims/SoCo). This gem would not be possible without his work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'sonos'
```

And then execute:

``` shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

``` shell
$ gem install sonos
```

## Usage

I'm working on a CLI client. For now, we'll use IRB.

``` shell
$ gem install sonos
$ irb
```

``` ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'sonos'
system = Sonos::System.new # Auto-discovers your system
speaker = system.speakers.first
```

Now that we have a reference to the speaker, we can do all kinds of stuff.

``` ruby
speaker.pause # Pause whatever is playing
speaker.play  # Resumes the playlist
speaker.play 'http://assets.samsoff.es/music/Airports.mp3' # Stream!
speaker.now_playing
speaker.volume
speaker.volume = 70
speaker.volume -= 10
speaker.queue
speaker.add_to_queue 'http://assets.samsoff.es/music/Airports.mp3'
speaker.remove_from_queue(speaker.queue[:items].last[:queue_id])
speaker.save_queue 'Jams'
speaker.clear_queue
```

### Topology

`Sonos.discover` finds the first speaker it can. We can get all of the Sonos devices (including Bridges, etc) by calling `Sonos.system.devices`. To get the groups, call `Sonos.system.groups`.

All of this is based off of the raw `Sonos.system.topology`.

### CLI

There is a very limited CLI right now. You can run `sonos devices` to get the IP of all of your devices.

You can also run `sonos pause_all` to pause all your Sonos groups.

## To Do

### General

* Handle errors better
* Handle line-in in `now_playing`
* Detect fixed volume
* Detect stereo pair
* CLI client for everything
* Nonblocking calls with Celluloid::IO

### Features

* Manipulating groups doesn't update `System#groups`
* Pause all (there is no play all in the controller, we could loop through and do it though)
* Party Mode
* Line-in
* Toggle cross fade
* Toggle shuffle
* Set repeat mode
* Search music library
* Browse music library
* Skip to song in queue
* Alarm clock
* Sleep timer
* Pandora doesn't use the Queue. I bet things are all jacked up.
* CONNECT (and possibly PLAY:5) line in settings
    * Source name
    * Level
    * Autoplay room
    * Autoplay include grouped rooms

### Maybe

If we are implementing everything the official Sonos Controller does, here's some more stuff:

* Set zone name and icon
* Create stero pair
* Support for SUB
* Support for DOCK
* Support for CONNECT:AMP (not sure if this is any different from CONNECT)
* Manage services
* Date and time
* Wireless channel
* Audio compression
* Automatically check for updates (not sure if this is a controller only preference)
* Local music servers
* Add component
